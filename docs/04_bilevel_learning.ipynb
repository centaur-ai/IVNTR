    "# IVNTR Bilevel Learning: Neural Predicate Invention\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the core IVNTR algorithm implemented in `predicators/approaches/bilevel_learning_approach.py`. IVNTR (bIleVel learNing from TRansitions) learns neural predicates that enable symbolic planning from demonstration data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Core Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "IVNTR implements a **bilevel learning approach** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Upper Level (Symbolic)**: Searches over candidate predicate effects and constructs NSRTs\n",
    "2. **Lower Level (Neural)**: Learns predicate classifiers using **Any** Neural Networks\n",
    "3. **Alternating Process**: The two levels guide each other through iterative refinement\n",
    "\n",
    "For each predicate, IVNTR alternates between:\n",
    "- **Effect Discovery**: Searching for high-level symbolic effects the predicate should have\n",
    "- **Grounding Learning**: Training neural networks to classify when the predicate holds\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Focus: \"IsCalibrated\" Predicate\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll examine the simplest predicate invention process using the \"IsCalibrated\" predicate:\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Determines if a satellite has been calibrated and is ready to take readings\n",
    "- **Input**: Continuous feature vectors of satellites (position, calibration state, instrument type, ...)\n",
    "- **Output**: Binary classification (calibrated or not)\n",
    "- **Role**: Required precondition for camera, geiger, and infrared readings\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Cover\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dummy NSRTs**: Starting point with incomplete effect knowledge.\n",
    "2. **Demonstration Data**: Training examples from oracle trajectories.\n",
    "3. **Neural Learning Process**: If we have perfect AE vector, how to train a neural network (single iteration).\n",
    "4. **Symbolic Search Process**: If we do not know the AE vector, how to use neural loss to guide the search (multiple iterations).\n",
    "5. **Advanced In-depth Highlight**: Binary predicate, variable bindings, quantifiers, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive in!"

    "## 8. Advanced Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have gone through how IVNTR:\n",
    "- Trains neural networks with effect vector labels.\n",
    "- Performs symbolic effect search with neural guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "To invent all the predicates in satellites domain, please see `scripts/train/satellites/satellites_biplan.sh` and also check the predicate learning configurations `predicators/config/satellites/pred.yaml`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We next highlights some advanced implementation in predicate learning for better understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Predicates\n",
    "\n",
    "`IsCalibrated(?sat)` is a unary predicate that takes in feature vectors of a single entity (object/satellite). For binary predicates, we input the concatination of feature vectors. details see `predicators/approaches/bilevel_learning_approach.py::gen_graph_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Bindings\n",
    "\n",
    "IVNTR algorithm made an implicit assumption that, for a certain predicate, it can only appear at most once in the effect set of an operator (add effect or delete effect or no effect). However, there are cases where a single predicate appears twice, e.g., in `Blocks` domain we have the `Clear(?block)` predicate like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "UnStack::\n",
    "    ?x0:block, ?x1:block, ?x2:robot\n",
    "    pre-cond:\n",
    "        HandEmpty(?x2),\n",
    "        On(?x0,?x1),\n",
    "        Clear(?x0)\n",
    "    add-eff:\n",
    "        Holding(?x2,?x0),\n",
    "        Clear(?x1)\n",
    "    del-eff:\n",
    "        HandEmpty(?x2),\n",
    "        On(?x0,?x1),\n",
    "        Clear(?x0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, `Clear(?block)` can't be fully captured by [0,1,-1] effect vectors. To tackle this, each predicate is additionally associated with a varibale binding index, and we only learn&evaluate the specified variable binding (which varible in the operator should be binded to the predicate). In the code we used `ent_idx` (default to 0) for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will invent two predicates to capture the original `Clear(?block)`, with `Clear1(?block)_0` (it only binds the first block variable in any operator) and `Clear2(?block)_1` (it only binds the second block variable in any operator). And this way, we can use the [0,1,-1] effect vectors to represent the distribution (another way to explain is that the varible binding is actually part of the effect search).\n",
    "For more details, you can try `Blocks` domain, and understand the code: `predicators/approaches/bilevel_learning_approach.py::ent_idx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Negation and Quantifiers\n",
    "Invented predicates can be augmented with negation (`Not`) and quantifiers (`ForAll` and `Exist`), the quantifiers can also be applied to different variables. The augmented predicates will be added to the predicate pool before predicate selection. details see L1725 of `predicators/approaches/bilevel_learning_approach.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicate Selection\n",
    "After we get the pool of neural predicates (low-loss classifiers), we conduct hill-climbing search similar to [previous work](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=CMcsygMAAAAJ&citation_for_view=CMcsygMAAAAJ:J_g5lzvAfSwC). The core algorithm evaluates a set of predicates by:\n",
    "1. Use the predicates to learn an operator set.\n",
    "2. Use the operator set to do task planning.\n",
    "3. Compare the generated task plan with demonstration length, and additionally capture search statistics (num_nodes_expanded / created).\n",
