# The info below is used to transform april tag x, y, z detections into object
# x, y, z. For example, if a tag is hanging off the side of a table, we would
# want to use the center of the table as the origin of the table object.
# Allowed regions. Each region is defined by a set of points
# that form the boundary of the region. We will check
# whether a pose is within the region by checking whether the
# robot will be within the convex hull of these boundary
# points.
